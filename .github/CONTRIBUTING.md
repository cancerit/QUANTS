# QUANTS: Contributing Guidelines

Hi there!
Many thanks for taking an interest in improving QUANTS.

We try to manage the required tasks for QUANTS using GitLab issues, you probably came to this page when creating one. Please check that there isn't already an issue about your idea in the [QUANTS issues](https://gitlab.internal.sanger.ac.uk/team113_nextflow_pipelines/QUANTS/-/issues) to avoid duplicating work.

General issues and suggestions are welcome!
Contributions to the code are even more welcome ;)
